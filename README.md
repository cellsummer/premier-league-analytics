# premier-league-analytics
This is my first web application developed using [Dash](https://plotly.com/) and its [Bootstrap Components](https://dash-bootstrap-components.opensource.faculty.ai/). The dataset is from [football-data](https://www.football-data.co.uk/englandm.php). The news API included in the application is [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).
